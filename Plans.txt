We plan to generate a handful of files with made up schedules on them.  Our
scenario is that we are detectives and we are searching through these files in
order to find out which suspect does not have an alibi listed on their schedule.

There are 3 suspects and the murder happened at 12:14.

We will search through the files to see whether or not the suspect has anything
scheduled at this time.
